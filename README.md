# Drum Kit

This is a web-based drum kit. It's a fun and interactive project that helped me to understand how to handle events in JavaScript.

## Description

This project is a virtual drum kit that can be played using the keyboard. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The drum kit includes seven different drum sounds, each mapped to a specific key on the keyboard.  

## Features

- Interactive UI: The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. Each drum sound is represented by a button on the screen, labeled with the key that triggers it.
- Keyboard Integration: The drum sounds are played by pressing the corresponding keys on the keyboard.
- Responsive Design: The drum kit is styled with CSS for a pleasant user interface that works on multiple screen sizes.

## How to Use

1. Open https://bulut-mustafa.github.io/Drum-Kit/ in your browser.
2. Click to buttons or the keys that correspond to the drum sounds (w, a, s, d, j, k, l).

## Dependencies

This project uses jQuery, which is loaded via a CDN in the HTML file.
